## üìà **Model**
The business question falls into the category of supervised machine learning for predicting continuous values, so linear regression models were used.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**
If you would like to download and run all the data analysis and prediction models on your own machine, it is recommended to use to **Anaconda** and **Jupyter Notebook**. If you use Anaconda most of the packages used in this project are pre-installed.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Built With**
  - [Python 3](http://www.python.org/) - Main programming language used, done in Jupyter Notebook.
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Main library used to manipulate the datasets.
  - [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Main library used for machine learning.
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Used for graph plots and visualizations.
  - [Python NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) - Used during exploratory analysis to get further insights into the textual data.
