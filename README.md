# **Airbnb Price Prediction**
What dictates Airbnb rental price? Is it the
  - Number of beds?
  - Number of guests allowed?
  - Review score?
  - Cancellation policy?

## 📖 **Overview**
The business question: **What predicts Airbnb rental price?**
The answer to this question provides interesting insights that can benefit a host looking to maximize their profits.

Before diving head first into the data and producing large correlation matrices, I always try to think of the question and get a sense of the features. Why am I doing this analysis? What’s the goal? What relationships between features and the target variable make sense?

## 📊 **Data**
The dataset has **74112 rows** and **28 columns** which includes many features such as: number of beds, number of guests allowed, description, number of reviews, and many more. For a more detailed preview into the features and the data, see the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stevezhenghp/airbnb-price-prediction)

## 🏗️ **Model**
The business question falls into the category of regression and prediction, so linear regression models were used.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**
If you would like to download and run all the data analysis and prediction models on your own machine, it is recommended to use to **Anaconda** and **Jupyter Notebook**. If you use Anaconda most of the packages used in this project are pre-installed.

## 🛠️ **Built With**
  - [Python 3](http://www.python.org/) - Main programming language used, done in Jupyter Notebook.
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Main library used to manipulate the datasets.
  - [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Main library used for machine learning.
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Used for graph plots and visualizations.
  - [Python NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) - Used during exploratory analysis to get further insights into the textual data.
